# Movie-Viewer

This is a test app that uses Kotlin. It is structured using Clean Architecture in a modular approach while using MVVM in the presentation layer. This app will be using popular libraries like Retrofit, Dagger, RX, Moshi and Architecture Components such as Livedata, Paging, Room, Lifecycle and ViewModel. It is also using JUnit, Google Truth, Espresso and Mockito for testing. This project is still a work in progress. Finished with the domain layer already including the appropriate testing. Currently working on the data layer.
